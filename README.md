# vkDocsBot
Telegram [inline bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline) that searches for files in VK Documents. The only thing you need is your VK API token.

## Summary
I made this bot for personal use, but I want to share its code.

__The code is adapted to work with [firebase cloud functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/).__ If you use another service, change the code to suit your needs. Keep in mind that the bot was running on [Telegraf v4.4.2](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf), which is outdated, so something may not work on newer versions.
